# Spring Framework Concepts

This project provides an overview and explanation of various Spring Framework concepts. The Spring Framework is a popular Java-based framework that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing robust and flexible applications. The key concepts covered in this project include annotations, beans, components, context, dependency injection, inversion of control (IoC), lazy initialization, eager initialization, scopes, and lifecycle callbacks using `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy`.

## Annotations

Annotations are a way to provide metadata and configuration to your Spring application. They can be applied to classes, methods, fields, or parameters to convey specific behaviors or characteristics. Spring Framework provides a rich set of annotations that simplify the configuration process and enhance application development.

## Beans

In the Spring Framework, a bean represents an object that is managed by the Spring container. It is created, configured, and assembled by the container using dependency injection. Beans can be defined using XML configuration or through annotations, allowing for flexible and modular application development.

## Component

The `@Component` annotation is used to mark a Java class as a Spring component. It enables auto-detection and automatic registration of the class as a bean in the Spring context. Components are the basic building blocks of a Spring application and can be used in conjunction with other annotations to specify different types of components.

## Context

The Spring context is the central interface for managing Spring beans and their configurations. It represents the runtime environment for a Spring application and provides access to the application context's beans and resources. The context is responsible for loading bean definitions, instantiating and wiring beans, and managing their lifecycle.

## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a core principle of the Spring Framework. It allows the dependencies of a class to be provided externally rather than being created within the class itself. Spring uses DI to manage and inject dependencies into beans, promoting loose coupling and enhancing testability and modularity.

## Inversion of Control (IoC)

Inversion of Control is a design principle closely related to Dependency Injection. It refers to the concept of delegating the control of object creation and management to an external container or framework. Spring implements IoC by creating and managing objects (beans) and their dependencies, thus inverting the traditional control flow of object creation.

## Lazy Initialization

Lazy initialization is a feature provided by Spring that defers the creation of a bean until it is actually requested. This can improve application startup time and memory usage, as beans are created only when needed. Beans can be lazily initialized by configuring the appropriate scope or using the `@Lazy` annotation.

## Eager Initialization

Eager initialization, on the other hand, ensures that a bean is created during the application startup process. This means that the bean instance is immediately available for use when needed. Eager initialization is the default behavior for Spring beans, but it can be explicitly configured using the appropriate scope or the `@Lazy(false)` annotation.

## Scopes

Scopes define the lifecycle and visibility of a bean within the Spring context. Spring supports several standard scopes, including singleton, prototype, request, session, and application. The choice of scope depends on the specific requirements of the application and how the beans are intended to be used.

## PostConstruct & PreDestroy

`@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` are lifecycle callbacks provided by Spring to perform initialization and destruction operations on beans. The `@PostConstruct` annotation is used to annotate a method that needs to be executed after dependency injection and bean initialization. Conversely, the `@PreDestroy` annotation is used to annotate a method that should be called before a bean is removed from the container.
